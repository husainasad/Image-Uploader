"# Image-Uploader" 
Image Uploader is a basic android application integrated with a flask server.
The user can use the application to click images, add tags and upload the clicked image to the server.
The server receives the image array and tag information in a post request. 
The image array is then converted back into the original image and stored in its respective 'tag' folder.
